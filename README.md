I am techinilogiocally impaired.  This is all new to me and I am excited to go forth into the great landscape of github.  It's like a more complicated version of Google Docs.  I like how simple it looks.

**I think I've figured it out.**


~~My whole life is a mistake.~~


**I wish I had _never_ been born at all.**
As Conor Oberst once sang: 
>Maybe the sun keeps coming up / because it's gotten used to you / and your constant need for proof.

# How Thunder storms form:
1. High and low pressure systems collide
    - cool dense air forces warm moist air to rise
    - rapid rise of warm air cools and condenses quickly
2. cumulus clouds form
    - large, dark clouds form with a lot of moist particles colliding and creating friction
    - lightning splits the sky
